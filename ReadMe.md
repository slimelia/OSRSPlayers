# Old School Runescape Player of the Day
This is the source code for my Cohost bot, [OSRSPlayers](https://cohost.org/OSRSPlayers).

The script selects a random OSRS user from the hiscores every day at 11am, Europe/London timezone.

Heavily relies on the very good [OSRS-Hiscores Python package](https://github.com/Coffee-fueled-deadlines/osrs-hiscores), a great library which also briefly infuriated me due to it spelling the RuneScape skill _Defence_ as _Defen**s**e_.
